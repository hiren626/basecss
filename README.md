-in this version you can use some basic css attributes by simply adding this class names to the relative element such as : 
---reset_base, bg_color#xxxxxx (where '#xxxxxx' stands for hex color code), t_color#xxxxxx, text_xxpx (where 'xxpx' represents '15px',it's the size of relative text), bold, italic.
-and card_view (as pre-fixed design).
